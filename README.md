#Omae v2

Omae is a character generator for Shadowrun 5th Edition.
[Live demo can be found here](heyomae.github.io).

##Technologies

* NodeJS - https://nodejs.org
* React - https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html
* Redux - http://rackt.org/redux/index.html
* Bootstrap 4 - http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/overview/
* Yeoman - http://yeoman.io/
* generator-react-webpack-redux - https://github.com/stylesuxx/generator-react-webpack-redux

##Getting Started

1. Install NodeJS from nodejs.org. I'm currently using Node 5.5.0, but in theory a few older versions should still work too.
2. Clone the repo (you may need to install git if you're running Windows, https://git-scm.com/download/win) ```git clone git@github.com:HeyOmae/Omae2.1.git```
3. Navigate to the directory you cloned the repo to. This is usually done with the command ```CD /path/to/directory/```
4. Install dependencies with ```npm install```
5. Run dev server with ```npm start``` Which should open a browser and run the app

##Dev Tools

Install Yeoman and the React-Webpack-Redux generator. You can skip this if you don't plan on contributing to the project.
```
	npm install -g yo generator-react-webpack-redux
```
