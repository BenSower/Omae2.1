##Getting Started

1. Install NodeJS from nodejs.org. I'm currently using Node 5.5.0, but in theory a few older versions should still work too.
2. Install Yeoman and the React-Webpack-Redux generator
```
	npm install -g yo generator-react-webpack-redux
```
3. Clone the repo (you may need to install git if you're running Windows, https://git-scm.com/download/win)
```
	git clone git@github.com:dethstrobe/Omae2.1.git
```
4. Navigate to the directory you cloned the repo to. This is usually done with the command ```CD /path/to/directory/```
5. Install dependencies with ```npm install```
6. Run dev server with ```npm start``` Which should open a browser and run the app
